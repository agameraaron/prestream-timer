History:
I needed countdown timer for announcing streams preferably alongside some text. I came up with this program to fulfill that need. I'm sure others have done it too, but I didn't bother looking. Felt like a good excuse to make my own little streaming tool.

To do:
- When minutes are input, divide by 60 and add to hours.
- When minutes are input, convert decimal entries to seconds.
- When hours are input, convert decimal entries to minutes & seconds.
- Selectable background color.
- The header and footer text editors should cohere with the text editors behind their display labels.
