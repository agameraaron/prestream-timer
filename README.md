Created & editable in the Godot Engine. https://godotengine.org/

Features:
- A countdown timer.
- An editable footer and header.

Why this exists:
I needed some text with a countdown timer for announcing streams. I asked 'LairGaming' about his opinion on scheduling streams and he mentioned it's feasible to keep an open schedule so long as I announce ahead of time. So I came up with this program. I'm sure others have done it too, I just didn't bother looking. Felt like a good excuse to make my own little streaming tool.

To do:
- Fix the seconds centering when decimals aren't involved
- When minutes are input, divide by 60 and add to hours.
- When minutes are input, convert decimal entries to seconds.
- When hours are input, convert decimal entries to minutes & seconds.
- Selectable background color.
- Selectable text color.
- Selectable fonts.
- The header and footer text editors need representative cohesion with the label they respectively transpose.
